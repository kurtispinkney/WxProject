## Objective

This is a project that aims to associate various weather phenomenon with their respective storm by relating disparate weather datasets. The end goal is to create an API interface that end users (students, researchers, etc.) can use to pull storm relative datasets made publicily available through the NOAA Big Data Project. 

## Data

NOAA has provided a wealth of data in an [AWS data registry](https://registry.opendata.aws/) as part of the [NOAA Big Data Project](https://www.noaa.gov/big-data-project). To start I'll work with GOES16 Global Lightning Mapper (GLM) data to relate flashes to their parent storm identified using NEXRAD L2 data.
